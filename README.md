# Diabetes-Detection

This Diabetes Detection project analyzes patient health data to predict diabetes using machine learning. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, correlations, and outliers. The project then applies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree classifiers to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic
